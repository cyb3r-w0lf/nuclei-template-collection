  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects if JavaScript is enabled in WebView. Enabling JavaScript in WebView can expose the application to various security vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection, especially when loading untrusted content.
  remediation: |
    Avoid enabling JavaScript in WebView unless necessary. When enabled, ensure that only trusted and validated content is loaded. Consider using `WebViewClient` and `WebChromeClient` to handle events securely.
