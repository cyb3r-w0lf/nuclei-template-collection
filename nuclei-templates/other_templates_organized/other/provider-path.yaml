  name: Insecure Provider Path Detection
  author: YoruYagami
  severity: medium
  description: |
    This template detects insecure `root-path` configurations in content providers. Using insecure paths like `"path=\".\""` or `"path=\"\""` can expose the entire file system of the application to other apps, leading to potential unauthorized access and data leakage. This misconfiguration can allow other apps to access sensitive files, potentially leading to path traversal or file disclosure vulnerabilities.
  remediation: |
    Avoid using broad `root-path` configurations such as `"path=\".\""` or `"path=\"\""` in your content provider definitions. Specify exact file paths or directories that should be shared and ensure that the `android:exported` attribute is set to `false` unless sharing is explicitly required. Always validate and sanitize paths to prevent path traversal attacks.
