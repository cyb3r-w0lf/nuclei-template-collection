  description: |
    "TapJacking" is an attack strategy where a malicious application displays a fake user interface that seems to accept user interactions but actually passes events such as finger presses to a hidden user interface behind it. This attack, similar to the web counterpart known as "Clickjacking," can be accomplished using the screen overlay functionality present in all recent versions of Android.
  remediation: |
    Developers can prevent this attack by ensuring that the attribute `filterTouchesWhenObscured` is set to true on all views or by implementing the method `onFilterTouchEventForSecurity()`.

    Example:

    ```xml
    <View
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:filterTouchesWhenObscured="true" />
    ```

    or

    ```java
    @Override
    public boolean onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(MotionEvent event) {
        if ((event.getFlags() & MotionEvent.FLAG_WINDOW_IS_OBSCURED) != 0) {
            // Drop the touch event.
            return false;
        }
        return super.onFilterTouchEventForSecurity(event);
    }
    ```
